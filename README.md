lli_undef_fix_admin
===================

administrative files for the lli_undef_fix project
This project uses the https://github.com/cschreiner/llvm repository as its
main repo.

This repository holds my developer scripts, project progress and questions,
and other things that can't go into the cschreiner/llvm repo because they
would just confuse the upstream llvm project when they pulled from the
cschreiner/llvm repo.
