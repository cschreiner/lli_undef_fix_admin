List of stuff to do sometime, as research requires:

[ ] figure out how to handle poison and pointers.  In particular,
indirecting or jumping off of a poisoned pointer should halt the
interpreter.  Is it enough to halt when the pointer value is set in a way
that depends on poison, or should we wait until the pointer value is
actually used?
