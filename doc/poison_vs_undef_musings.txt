Tradeoffs between poison and undef:

[ ] ANY proposal that uses short-circuit evaluation to remove overflow
taint (regardless of whether it is called poison, undef, or whatever)
appears to avoid the current problems with
simplify-the-control-flow-graph optimization.

[ ] As currently defined, the difference between poison and undef is
that an undef value, when read, may be assumed to be any value convenient for
optimization, while a poisoned value has a definite bit pattern
coupled with a requirement that it never be output.  (In effect,
poison requires the optimizer to do enough static analysis to
guarantee that a poison value can not be output.)
