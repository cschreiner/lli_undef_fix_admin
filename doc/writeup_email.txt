Writeup of Poison Research in project lli_undef_fix
----------------------------------------------------


The current specification of poison handling has holes, which have been
patched in the current LLVM implementation by human intuition and dilligent
debugging efforts.  Unfortunately, different people have different intuitive
understandings of how poison should work. \TODO{cite the discusssions of
poison on LLVM mailing list} This situation makes a precise formal definition
of poison handling impossible, allows occasional miscompilation in corner
cases, and prevents the compiler from applying many next generation compiler
optimizations.

We, the authors, have been studying the effects of different poison handling
rules on thousands of C programs, 

have created an LLVM IR interpreter capable of applying
different poison handling rules, and have
