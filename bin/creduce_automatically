# automatically create a workdir for creduce and fire it off.
# This is currently quickly written for homing in on the poison=undef
# question, a different "interestingness" script may be appropriate for
# other questions.

# TODO2: generalize this script to make it useful for questions other than
# the poison=undef.  Perhaps this could be done by specifying the
# "interestingness" script on the command line along with the .c file, of
# course in the same order one specifies them to creduce.
